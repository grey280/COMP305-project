		<h1>Abstract</h1>
		<p>This is the documentation for a course project in COMP305 Software Engineering, Spring 2017. The project is based upon <a target="_BLANK" href="./template.pdf">this template</a> and <a target="_BLANK" href="./project.pdf">this description</a>, and follows the development of an information technology system for a small business, <em>Showtime Sound &amp; Lighting</em>.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row" id="introduction">
		<div class="col-xs-12">
			<h1>Introduction</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-5">
			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p class="lead">The purpose of this report is to document the current status of the information technology systems at <em>Showtime Sound &amp; Lighting</em> and to lay out a plan of action to replace these systems with a new, custom-built system.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-7">
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p><em>Showtime Sound &amp; Lighting</em> has, to date, been using a system intended for a single user. At that small a scale, all of the information of the company can be said to exist in the mind of that single user, and whatever system they design for themselves is the best case. Unfortunately, such systems generally do not scale well for multiple employees, and with the current larger roster of employees, and future plans to further grow the company, developing a system that will function well for a larger number of employees is of critical importance.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-5">
			<h2>Scope</h2>
			<p>The system to be designed is for use by the employees of <em>Showtime Sound &amp; Lighting</em>. All interaction with the system by customers will be mediated by employees of the company, thus reducing the complication of outward-facing functionalities.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-7">
			<h2>Structure</h2>
			<p>The report begins with this <strong><a href="#introduction">introductory section</a></strong>, covering the purpose, background information, and scope of the project. From there, it goes to define the <strong><a href="#standardsspecs">standards and specifications</a></strong> used for the documentation of the project, and the environment in which the software was developed. From there, it goes to an in-depth <strong><a href="#systemspec">system specification</a></strong>, laying out the way the system will be designed. Next is the <strong><a href="#programspec">program specification</a></strong>, similar to the system specification but focusing on what the programmer(s) will need to construct and deliver the programs in the system. Then come the <strong><a href="#implementation">implementation details</a></strong>, covering the budget, staffing, and time needed to develp the system. Finally comes the <strong><a href="#conclusion">conclusion</a></strong>, providing a high-level summary of the report.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row" id="standardsspecs">
		<div class="col-xs-12">
			<h1>Standards and Specifications</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h2>Documentation</h2>
			<p>The documentation for this project follows the Unified Modeling Language structure, and will follow the various object-oriented design techniques described within that system.</p>
			<p>For a detailed explanation of any of the content used herein, see <em>Systems Analysis &amp; Design: An Object-Oriented Approach with UML</em> by Dennis, Wixom, and Tegarden.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h2>Technical Environment</h2>
			<p>The software will be developed on and for the Microsoft Windows computing environment, specifically making use of the Windows Forms software platform. Any computer capable of running Microsoft Windows 7 or later will be capable of running the client-side software. Also necessary will be a single computer to function as the central server, hosting the database and document storage systems.</p>

			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h2>Feasibility Analysis</h2>
			<h3>Technical</h3>
			<p>Developing the system within the Microsoft Windows software environment allows the employees to continue using the equipment they already have without the steep learning curve required by a new system. This also allows the company to continue using equipment they already have without requiring large-scale purchases.</p>
			<h3>Economic</h3>
			<p><abbr class="initialism" title="Showtime Sound &amp; Lighting"><em>SSL</em></abbr>, as a small company, has a capital budget of $15,000 for system development. Without development of the new system, however, an estimated loss of 5-10% of customers due to inefficiencies can cause a serious decrease in revenue.</p>
			<h3>Organizational</h3>
			<p>Since <abbr class="initialism" title="Showtime Sound &amp; Lighting"><em>SSL</em></abbr> currently only has 4 employees, training all of them to use a new system - especially one well-designed around the needs of the company - would not require a significant time investment. Switching to the new system now, prior to the planned increase in the staffing of the company, also allows the use of the new system to replace the use of the old system in new employee training, and thus reduces the burden on all employees.</p>

			<h2>Budget &amp; Personnel Requirements</h2>
			<p>Five programmers, headed by Jane Ackerman and John Holmes. Each programmer should have knowledge of Access, C#, and other such skills. There should be no need for specialists. Since the budget for this program is minimal, $15,000 dollars, the staffing team should be small.</p>
			<h2>Backup &amp; Recovery Strategies</h2>
			<p>The project should be backed up on the team's hard drive, and online. When programming, the programmers should back up their work on the central git repository. Recovering corrupted or overwritten information is much easier when using a cloud-based git repository like Github.</p>
			<h2>Schedule</h2>
			<p>Tom Smith wishes to expand his business to fifteen employees in the next five years. This project should be completed within a year, beginning on May 29th, 2017 and ending on May 25th, 2018. The planning phase is from May 29th to July 28th, 2017. Next, the analysis phase will take place from July 31st to November 24th, 2017. Then, the design phase will take place from November 25th, 2017 and end January 25th, 2018. Finally, the implementation will be from January 26th to May 25th, 2018. After its completion, the program should aid Mr. Smith's expansion throughout the next four years.</p>

			<h1>Recommendations and Conclusion</h1>
			<p>This report documented the current status of the information technology systems at <em>Showtime Sound &amp; Lighting</em> and laid out a plan of action to replace those systems with a new, custom-built system. To date, <abbr class="initialism" title="Showtime Sound &amp; Lighting"><em>SSL</em></abbr> has been using a single-user system based upon a mix of paper forms and Microsoft Office documents. As the company has expanded, and plans to continue doing so, developing a system that will function better at a larger scale is very necessary to prevent major inefficiencies from costing the company customers and revenue.</p>
			<p>This report contains design documents for a new system that <abbr class="initialism" title="Showtime Sound &amp; Lighting"><em>SSL</em></abbr> could use. The system is designed for the current and future needs of the company, and would allow for much easier scaling of their information technology systems to keep pace with the planned rate of growth for the company.</p>
			<p>To <abbr class="initialism" title="Showtime Sound &amp; Lighting"><em>SSL</em></abbr>, we recommend they move forward with the development and, later, the use of the system designed within this document.</p>
